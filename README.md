# **On-premise Database Design and Implementation**

An online retail company currently stores its data across various computers in different locations, using multiple formats and versions depending on the branch. I have been asked to consult on how to unify and standardize all this data into a single format that can be centrally managed. I have proposed implementing an on-premises SQL repository that consolidates all data in one location and can be accessed globally by employees.
